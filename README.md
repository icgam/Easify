# Easify

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/6fqw0sy0jp6s584o?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/moattarwork/flache) ![](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Easify.svg?style=flat-square)

## Introduction

Easify is a set of libraries which facilitate different aspects of a Restful/Microservice api and takes away the boilerplate configuration/bootstrap code that needs to be written each time a new API project is setup. There are up's and down's to this approach, however the benefit of this approach is to setup consistent api projects faster and easier.

## Features

Boilerplate api provides the following features:

* Global Error Handling
* Preconfigured Logging to a rolling file and log aggregartors such as loggly and seq
* Application/Common services preregistration within IOC container
* Request Correlation
* Preconfigured MVC pipeline
* FluentValidation framework integration
* AutoMapper integration with desired IOC container
* RestEase REST client integration
* Swagger integration
* Health endpoint exposed
* Diagnostics endpoint

For using the full benefit of the library, Create a simple asp.net core project and install *EasyApi.AspNetCore.Bootstrap* nuget package.

```cmd

dotnet add package Easify.AspNetCore.Bootstrap

or
 
Install-Package Easify.AspNetCore.Bootstrap

```

In order to achieve all of this functionality you merely need a few lines of code. At this point your *Program.cs* should look like this:

```csharp


    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            WebHost.Run<Startup>(s =>  s.ConfigureLogger<Startup>());
        }
    }

```

 And *startup.cs* as follows:

 ```csharp

    public class Startup
    {
        public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            Configuration = configuration;
        }

        private IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

        public IServiceProvider ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            return services.BootstrapApp<Startup>(Configuration,
                            app => app
                                .HandleApplicationException<TemplateApiApplicationException>()
                                .AddServices((container, config) => { })
                        );
        }

        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
        {
            app.UseDefaultApiPipeline(Configuration, env, loggerFactory);
        }
    }

 ```

The project/solution is ready to be running in visual studio or using dotnet cli.
